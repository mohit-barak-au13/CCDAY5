Q1 : Write the calculator program which will take input from users two numbers
     And will ask them to type
     0 for addition
     1 for subtraction
     2 for multiplication
     3 for division
     And will print the result?


a = int(input("Enter a number      :"))
b = int(input("Enter second number :"))
print("Which operation you would like to do....")
print("press 0 for addition")
print("press 1 for subtraction")
print("press 2 for multiplication")
print("press 3 for divison")

x = int(input("Give the digit :"))
if(x==0):
    sum = a+b
    print("Addition of both the numbers is :",sum)
elif(x==1):
    subtraction = a-b
    print("Subtraction of both the numbers is :",subtraction)
elif(x==2):
    multiplication = a*b
    print("Multiplication of both numbers is :",multiplication)
elif(x==3):
    division = a/b
    print("Division of both numbers is :",division)


Question 2: Explain range in python with various examples ?

Ans : The range() function returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, 
      and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.
      Syntax: range (start, stop, step)   
      Example:-
      list(range(0,5)) will print 0,1,2,3,4      (In this range by default step will be 1)
      list(range(0,10,2)) will print 0,2,4,6,8   (In this range the steps will take gap of 2 in range)
      list(range(10,0,-2)) will print 10,8,6,4,2 (In this range the steps will take gap of 2 but in negative)

Question 3: What will be the result of..
            int(6.6) + int(4.9) = ?

Ans : The result will be false because we can not store float value in int.
